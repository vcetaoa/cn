## Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm

### Core Algorithm

1. **Initialization**: Set the initial distances from the starting node to all other nodes as infinite, except for the starting node itself, which is set to 0. Create a priority queue and add the starting node.

2. **Processing Nodes**:
   - While the priority queue is not empty:
     - Extract the node with the smallest distance from the queue.
     - For each neighboring node, calculate the distance through the current node.
     - If this new distance is smaller than the known distance, update it and add the neighbor to the priority queue.

3. **Completion**: The algorithm ends when all nodes have been processed, resulting in the shortest paths from the starting node to all other nodes.

import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    # Initialize distances and priority queue
    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    priority_queue = [(0, start)]

    while priority_queue:
        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)

        # Process neighbors
        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node].items():
            distance = current_distance + weight
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (distance, neighbor))

    return distances

# Example usage

    }

    start_node = 'A'
    shortest_paths = dijkstra(graph, start_node)

    # Improved output formatting
    print(f"Shortest paths from node '{start_node}':")

## Distance Vector Routing Algorithm

### Algorithm

1. **Initialization**: Each router initializes its distance table. The distance to itself is 0, and the distance to all other routers is set to infinity (or a very large number).

2. **Exchange Information**: Each router sends its distance table to its immediate neighbors.

3. **Update Distances**:
   - When a router receives a distance table from a neighbor, it updates its own table using the Bellman-Ford equation:
     \[
     	ext{new\_distance}(destination) = \min(	ext{old\_distance}(destination), 	ext{distance\_to\_neighbor} + 	ext{cost\_to\_neighbor})
     \]
   - If the distance to a destination changes, the router notifies its neighbors of the update.

4. **Repeat**: Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until no more updates occur, indicating that all routers have converged on the shortest paths.

### CODE

```python
class Router:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.distance_table = {}
        self.neighbors = {}

    def add_neighbor(self, neighbor, cost):
        self.neighbors[neighbor] = cost
        self.distance_table[neighbor] = cost
        self.distance_table[self.name] = 0  # Distance to itself is 0

    def update_distance_table(self, neighbor_table):
        for destination, distance in neighbor_table.items():
            new_distance = self.distance_table[self.name] + self.neighbors[neighbor] + distance
            if destination not in self.distance_table or new_distance < self.distance_table[destination]:
                self.distance_table[destination] = new_distance
                # Notify neighbors about the update (in real implementation)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create routers
    router_a = Router("A")
    router_b = Router("B")
    router_c = Router("C")

    # Define neighbors and their costs
    router_a.add_neighbor("B", 1)
    router_a.add_neighbor("C", 4)
    router_b.add_neighbor("A", 1)
    router_b.add_neighbor("C", 2)
    router_c.add_neighbor("B", 2)

    # Example of updating distance tables
    router_a.update_distance_table(router_b.distance_table)
    router_b.update_distance_table(router_c.distance_table)

    # Print distance tables
    print(f"Distance table for Router A: {router_a.distance_table}")
    print(f"Distance table for Router B: {router_b.distance_table}")
    print(f"Distance table for Router C: {router_c.distance_table}")

### Key Differences Between the Algorithms

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm** focuses on finding the shortest path from a single source to all other nodes, using a priority queue to explore the nearest nodes first.
- **Distance Vector Routing** focuses on maintaining and updating distance tables among all routers in the network, using information shared from neighbors.

Both algorithms serve important roles in network routing but operate on different principles and methods of communication.
